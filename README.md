**Manual Testing Project – Evershop Search Feature**

This project focuses on manual testing of the Search functionality on the Evershop Demo Store (https://demo.evershop.io/). The goal is to validate how accurately and efficiently the search feature returns results for different inputs and conditions.

**The repository includes:

Test Plan: Scope, objectives, and approach for testing.

Test Cases: Detailed scenarios covering functional, UI, negative, and boundary tests.

Bug Reports: Documented defects with clear reproduction steps and screenshots.

Execution Results: Pass/fail reports and key observations.

This project highlights practical manual testing skills — from writing test cases and executing them to analyzing results and reporting bugs. It demonstrates the ability to ensure quality, usability, and reliability in a core e-commerce feature.

Future improvements include automation of major test cases and coverage of advanced search features like filters and sorting.
